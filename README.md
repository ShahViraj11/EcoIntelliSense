## Inspiration
Our inspiration came from a real-world incident at Michigan State University, where a bridge was dismantled due to the use of carcinogenic materials in its construction. This not only caused significant inconvenience for the campus community but also highlighted the urgent need for environmentally conscious building practices.

## What it does
EcoIntelliSense is an innovative application designed to guide construction companies in adopting sustainable and eco-friendly approaches. It aids in selecting non-toxic, renewable resources, ensuring safer and more sustainable construction projects while also, providing them with estimations on how much money they can save by not using traditional sources of energy.

## How we built it
Our team developed EcoIntelliSense by integrating HTML,CSS and JS frontend with a Flask app using several apis like Google maps, Solar, Labour and Weather and comprehensive databases of sustainable materials and practices. We focused on user-friendly interfaces to make it accessible for construction professionals, enabling them to make informed decisions easily.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the major challenges was compiling a project of this large magnitude and then hosting it on a server where it can run as smoothly as possible and generate accurate reports of eco-friendly materials that are both sustainable and commercially viable. Additionally, ensuring the app's recommendations complied with various construction regulations and standards was a complex task.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are particularly proud of creating a platform that not only promotes environmental sustainability but also ensures public safety by avoiding harmful materials. Our app has the potential to transform the construction industry by making eco-friendly choices straightforward and accessible.

## What we learned
Throughout this project, we learned the intricacies of sustainable construction practices and the importance of balancing environmental concerns with practical construction needs. We also gained insights into user experience design, ensuring our app is both informative and easy to use.

## What's next for EcoIntelliSense
Looking ahead, we aim to expand EcoIntelliSense's capabilities by including real-time analytics, predictive modeling for environmental impact assessments, and partnerships with leading sustainable material suppliers. Our goal is to make EcoIntelliSense an indispensable tool for the future of green construction.
